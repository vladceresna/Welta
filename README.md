## ✨ Key Features of Welta v0.5

Welta v0.5 introduces significant enhancements focused on connecting people with **shared interests** and **local proximity**.

### Filter by Interest and Location
The long-awaited filters are here! Now you can easily narrow down the conversations you see:

* **Interest:** Type a keyword like "football" in the filters field to chat only with others who have selected the same interest.
* **Location:** Use filters for cities or regions to find and connect with people who live nearby.

### Integration with Rosto Mail
Welta now operates as a specialized forum service, with all profile and private communication functionality handled by the central **Rosto Mail** service.

* Pressing the profile button in Welta will open your profile in the Rosto app.
* This approach **saves users' memory** by removing profile features from Welta, ensuring the system works as a unified whole.

## 🌐 The Rula Ret-System

**Rula** (a "ret-system," meaning "net-system") is a cohesive platform developed by an independent developer, Vlad Ceresna, with a focus on addressing the flaws found in other systems. It operates at zero cost—neither charging users nor generating revenue for the developer.

### Why Choose Rula?

1.  **Unique Cohesion:** As a "ret-system," all Rula services are organized and tightly integrated.
2.  **Rapid, Bug-Free Updates:** Rula receives functional updates twice as fast as those from large corporations, and these updates are rigorously tested to ensure they never ship with bugs.
3.  **Enhanced Security:** Rula hides your **real email address** from other users. Instead, all actions (like messages) are signed using your unique identifier, the **RulaID**, keeping your personal information safe.

### Rula's Services

| Service | Version | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Welta** | 0.5 | The core forum service for connecting people by interest and location. |
| **Rosto Mail** | 0.1 | The main mail service and central tool for **account management** and **private communication** using the secure RulaID system. |

> **Note:** For the Rula system to function properly, you **must be logged in with the same account across all services** (Welta and Rosto Mail).
